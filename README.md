# VBA-challenge

Module 02

Script:
The script in this repository was created to analyse stoks data in excel thoughout the years, providing summary results and comparisons between stocks for different years.

Images:
There are 3 images representing the results of each year, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Running the script:
There is a button you can just click and run the script. The results will appear on all the worksheets at once.

CODE SOURCE:
- Not a single line was copied from anywhere, but I used LINER IA as a resource to understand some parts of the code. These parts were to determine the upper limit of the for to make it stpo, and the second part was to figure out how to run the code on all spreadsheets at the same time. My coleagues tiped me on this last part also on the Slack chat.




NOTE: THE SECOND PART OF THE SCRIPT (FUNCTIONALITY) IS NOT RUNNING ON THE 1ST TIME, ONLY AFTER THE 2ND TIME THE TABLE WILL APPEAR WITH THE ALL THE ACCURATE RESULTS. I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO FIX. THIS IS JUST TO INFORM THAT IS NOT  100%, BUT IT IS WORKING SOMEHOW.
